# price_ab_test
A data challenge to explore the effect after increasing the price of the software. 

Company XYZ sells a software package for $39. Since revenue has been flat for some time, the
VP of Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase
revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random
sample of 33% users a higher price ($59).
The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding
how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.
